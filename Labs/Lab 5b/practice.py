    # The rating for {movie} is {rating}
    # using this list:
    movies = ["Toy Story", "Toy Story 2", "Toy Story 3"]

    # 4. write a loop that prints
    # The rating for {movie} is {rating}
    # for ALL of the movies, by iterating over all of the (movie, rating)
    # tuples in the entire dictionary.
